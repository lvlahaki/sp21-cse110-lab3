                <p>I had a <i>very</i> busy day today! I had class all morning, then did laundry and cleaning around noon. Then I got some school work done and practiced guitar for a bit. </p>
                <div>Here's a bit of a song I'm working on:</div>

                <p>In the late afternoon, I had a really nice meeting with my research group. Then I walked my dog and took a short walk for myself.</p>

                <p>Today I woke up pretty late. I wrote a bit of a short story in the morning, then worked a little bit on my research project. I tried to start my <span>CSE 135</span> homework, but now I have to wait until I get my github credits. :( In the afternoon, I had class. Then I took Billy out for his walk, and then took my own.</p>

                <p>There was a <b>box of lemons</b> on someone's lawn, so I took one. It smells nice. My mom went grocery shopping while I was on my walk because she's <strong>vaccinated</strong> and I'm not.</p>
                <div>Here are some things I added to her list:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li style="color:darkgoldenrod">Plantains</li>
                    <li style="color:#800080">Frozen berries</li>
                    <li style="color:rgb(4, 77, 4)">Frozen spinach</li>
                    <li style="color:hsl(33, 68%, 70%)">Hummus</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I washed a <b>lot</b> of dishes in the evening, and listened to some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9hFTDzkw2k">space pirate folk punk music.</a></p>

                <p>I stayed up too late last night reading, and had to wake up for class this morning. I think I payed attention pretty well, despite being <em>so very sleepy.</em> I read some more after class, then I started working on my <span>CSE 110</span> lab! Later, if my <b>github credits appear >:(</b> I'll work on my <span>CSE 135</span> assignment. Otherwise, I'll write some more and take my daily walk.</p>
                <div>There are a lot of stray cats in my neighborhood. Here's one that looks like it has three eyes!!</div>

                <p>I think it's psychic. <br>I hope I see it again soon.</p>
